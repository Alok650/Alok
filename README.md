# A. Image classification
This project involves training a simple CNN to classify CIFAR images. It uses the Keras Sequential API.

CIFAR dataset contains 60,000 color images in 10 different classes. The dataset has been divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The classes are mutually exclusive and hence, they have no overlap.

Keras is a high level API used to write shorter codes (Approx. 1000 lines of python code can be written by using just 5 functions of Keras). It is a subset of TensorFlow

This model was made as a final project submission for the ShapeAI Bootcamp on Computer Vision.

# B. Clothing classfication

This project involves useing the Keras Tuner to find the best hyperparameters for a machine learning model that classifies images of clothing from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Data set

Dataset has been taken from kaggle and has been uploaded for reference.
